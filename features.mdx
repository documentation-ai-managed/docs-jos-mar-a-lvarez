## Page Organization and Hierarchies

You organize your documentation into intuitive hierarchies, mimicking a file system with pages, subpages, and sections. This structure keeps content discoverable, even as your project grows to hundreds of pages.

Use nested pages to group related topics. For example, place API references under a "Developer" parent page, with endpoints as children.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Home] --> B[Projects]
    B --> C[Project Alpha]
    C --> D[Setup]
    C --> E[API]
    A --> F[Team]
    F --> G[Roles]
    F --> H[Onboarding]
```

<Steps>

  | Feature | Benefit |
  |---------|---------|
  | Hierarchies | Easy navigation |
  ```
  ```html
  <h2>Heading</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>List item</li>
    <li>Another item</li>
  </ul>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Feature</th><th>Benefit</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Hierarchies</td><td>Easy navigation</td></tr>
  </table>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Version Control and History

Every edit creates a version snapshot, allowing you to track changes, compare diffs, and restore previous states. This prevents data loss and supports auditing.

<Expandable title="View Change History" default-open="true">
  Right-click a page in the sidebar and select "History." Browse commits by date, author, or summary.
  
  Revert by clicking "Restore this version." You receive notifications for major changes from collaborators.
</Expandable>

<Callout kind="info">
  Version history retains up to 100 snapshots per page. Export diffs as JSON for external tools.
</Callout>

## Collaboration and Sharing Options

Invite team members to co-edit docs in real-time. Set permissions like view-only, edit, or admin per page or workspace.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Invite Users" icon="user-plus">
    Go to workspace settings > Members. Enter emails and assign roles.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Share Links" icon="share-2">
    Generate public or password-protected links. Track views and edits.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

| Option | Permissions | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Workspace Invite | Full access | Core team |
| Page Share | View/Edit | Clients |
| Public Link | Read-only | Documentation |

Start by organizing your first hierarchy, then invite collaborators to build together. For more, see [quickstart](/quickstart).
